    We have three tables. They are created with the following SQL commands:\n

    CREATE TABLE companies (id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,company_logo_url TEXT,company_logo_text TEXT,company_name TEXT,relation_to_event TEXT,event_url TEXT,company_revenue TEXT,n_employees TEXT,company_phone TEXT,company_founding_year TEXT,company_address TEXT,company_industry TEXT,company_overview TEXT,homepage_url TEXT,linkedin_company_url TEXT,homepage_base_url TEXT,company_logo_url_on_event_page TEXT,company_logo_match_flag TEXT);\n
